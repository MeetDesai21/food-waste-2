# Sentimental Analysis

## Description
Welcome to the `sentimental-analysis` repository! This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis using text data. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone or opinion expressed in a piece of text. This repository includes a Python script named `sentiment_analysis_project.py` that demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on text data.

## Features
- **Text Sentiment Classification:** Classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Customizable Algorithm:** Easily adaptable to different sentiment analysis models and algorithms.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes basic text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Extensible:** Designed to be easily extended with additional features and models.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `nltk`: Natural Language Toolkit for tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Data visualization.

## Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentimental-analysis.git
   cd sentimental-analysis
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download NLTK data:**
   ```bash
   python -m nltk.downloader all
   ```

## Usage
To run the sentiment analysis project, execute the following command:

```bash
python sentiment_analysis_project.py
```

The script will perform sentiment analysis on a sample dataset and print out the results. You can modify the script to use your own dataset or customize the sentiment analysis model as per your requirements.
