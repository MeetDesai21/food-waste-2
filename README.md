To add a new product, you can modify the `src/data/products.js` file. Here's an example of how a product entry looks:

### Using React Router

To navigate between different pages, use the `Link` component from `react-router-dom`:

```js
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/products">Products</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/cart">Cart</Link></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
}
